100	<p>Gene therapy can be a solution for the painful side effects that come with traditional cancer treatments. It is a method of replacing or repairing genes that are not functioning correctly. Gene therapy provides an advanced cancer treatment strategy. Researchers are working on several gene therapies, including immunotherapies, cancer vaccines, and oncolytic virotherapies that can help treat cancer effectively.</p><p>In gene editing therapy, doctors can precisely make changes to the genes in cells that have caused cancer or are likely to cause it. They can add or eliminate genes that produce proteins that help cancer grow. Researchers have found that when used in combination with traditional therapies, gene editing treatment can be highly effective in eliminating cancer cells in patients.</p><p>The primary advantage of gene editing therapy is that it is a precise and targeted method of treatment. Instead of using traditional therapies that damage healthy cells in the body, gene therapy targets cancer cells based on their genetic profile. With this method, patients receive highly effective treatment that reduces the risks and side effects associated with traditional therapies. </p><p>Another benefit of gene therapy treatment is that it can provide long-term results. Targeted gene therapy works to remove malignant cells from the body and promotes the growth of healthy cells, preventing the recurrence of cancer in the future. This therapy provides a more advanced approach to targeting specific mutated genes in cancer cells, thereby reducing tumor size and helping to slow or stop the growth of cancerous cells, ultimately improving patients' prognosis and quality of life </p><p>In conclusion, gene therapy holds great potential as an effective and safe method of treating cancer. It is a precise, targeted, and long-lasting treatment that can provide better outcomes for patients who undergo cancer treatment. </p>	{"Precise and targeted method of cancer treatment","Reduced risks and side effects compared to traditional therapies","Long-term results for cancer patients","Effective in eliminating cancer cells in patients"}	\N	Varies depending on the specific gene therapy used and the patient's condition.
